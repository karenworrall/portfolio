She wrote the landing page info, welcome letter, sales pages, product description, my story, FAQs, contact page - the entire site. She created two taglines for my company - one for the product, 'Relax - Replenish - Revitalize', and one to engage prospective customers to make a call to action 'Because carers need care too'. She wrote me a script and gave me content strategies for my social media platforms and gave me advice on marketing techniques to help me gain traffic. Her writing is very high quality and she's great to work with - very helpful, friendly, goes above and beyond the project requirement, and genuinely cares about her clients and helping them get their business up and running. I'll definitely hire her again and I'd highly recommend her for any project.",

Her writing has flair and insight. She understands the tone of voice, theme and message that I want my show to give, and her words contribute greatly to spreading that message. Her travel knowledge is broad and she has first-hand knowledge of many worldwide destinations which, along with her great research skills, make her an expert writer in the travel genre. She's a very hard worker and produces high-quality copy, and works well to tight deadlines when needed. I'd highly recommend her for any content, copywriting or script writing project and will be continuing to use her services for my show.",

She wrote the landing page info, welcome letter, sales pages, product description, my story, FAQs, contact page - the entire site. She created two taglines for my company - one for the product, 'Relax - Replenish - Revitalize', and one to engage prospective customers to make a call to action 'Because carers need care too'. She wrote me a script and gave me content strategies for my social media platforms and gave me advice on marketing techniques to help me gain traffic. Her writing is very high quality and she's great to work with - very helpful, friendly, goes above and beyond the project requirement, and genuinely cares about her clients and helping them get their business up and running. I'll definitely hire her again and I'd highly recommend her for any project.",

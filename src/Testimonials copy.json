She worked diligently and enthusiastically on multiple projects, including writing and researching original content, picture research and sub-editing. Karen was a pleasure to have in the office, and I was impressed by her passion, work ethic and flexibility. She will be a great addition to any organisation in the future and I wish her the best as in her career.",

While working on-board with Karen she was one that I could always approach when I needed volunteers outside of her current job description. Karen was always someone I can count on without any problems. When she approached me about becoming a Future Cruise Consultant I had no doubt that she would represent On-board Sales perfectly. Karen was one of the top performers within the first few months she started and was always striving to exceed those targets with new ideas. She has been one of the reasons why I enjoy working with On-board Sales and the Future Cruise Consultants.",
